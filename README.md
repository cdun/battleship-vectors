# Battleships

This repository is a (na√Øve) implementation of Battleships using vector math. The geometry/vector classes are essentially copies of the implementations found in popular 3D gameplay frameworks - in this case, from ThreeJS.

- Vector 3 (https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=vec#api/en/math/)
- Box 2 (https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=box#api/en/math/Box2)
